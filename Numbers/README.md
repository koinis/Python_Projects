# Numbers

This is a python program which takes as input a "n" positive integer and prints all prime numbers which are less than "n" or equal to "n".

The program is fast because it checks primality by comparing the currently tested number only with the primes found so far.

*Hint: Prime number, is called any positive integer greater than 1 that has only two positive integer divisors. The number 1 and himself.
