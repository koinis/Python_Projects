# Interest Rate

This is a Python program which manages interest rates.

i) The user inputs a "capital" positive real number.

ii) The user inputs a sequence of real numbers "rates" which contains the interest rates of deposits (percent) over a number of years.

(eg The sequence 1.5, 1.75, 1.5, 1.25, means that first year the interest rate is 1.5%, the second 1.75%, the third 1.5% and the fourth 1.25%).

iii) Prints the initial capital and what will be the capital after the passage of each of the years.   

(eg After the end of the first year, the capital is c1 = (capital+capital * 1.5/100) after the second year the capital is c2 = (c1+c1 * 1.75/100), etc)
